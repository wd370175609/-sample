/**
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it
 * might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new
 * stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a
 * data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
 * composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the
 * previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop()
 * should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should
 * return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 *
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation
 * on a specific sub-stack.
